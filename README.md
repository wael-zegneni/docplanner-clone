# Docplanner Clone

This project is a clone of the Docplanner website (https://www.docplanner.com/), intended to demonstrate a frontend development skill set including React.js, SASS, SEO, and WCAG compliance.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to replicate the design and functionality of the Docplanner website, with a focus on creating a responsive and accessible user experience. The project uses React.js for the frontend to create a dynamic and interactive user interface, alongside SASS for advanced styling capabilities.

## Features

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **SASS (SCSS Syntax)**: A powerful extension of CSS that allows for variables, nested rules, mixins, and more.
- **SEO-Friendly**: Implementing best practices to ensure the website is optimized for search engines.
- **WCAG Compliant**: Ensuring the website is accessible to a wide range of people, including those with disabilities.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout works on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Project Structure

The project is structured with a focus on component modularity and styling cohesion. Each React component has a corresponding SASS file, and all styling is centralized through a main SASS file.
